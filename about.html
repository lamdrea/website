            Hello!
            <br><br>
            I'm Andrea, a Toronto-based biomedical communicator. I graduated with an MSc in Biomedical Communications from
            the University of Toronto in 2018, and also have a BSc in Biology from McMaster University. I'm passionate about 
            communicating ideas in science and medicine through accurate, thoughtful, and compelling visual designsâ€”whether 
            that's through storytelling, UX/UI design, 2D or 3D animation! I'm an avid learner and love tackling 
            challenges in conveying scientific concepts in new, purposeful ways.
            <br><br>
            You can often find me playing video games (lately Animal Crossing and Valorant) and doodling cute things. 
            I'm currently working at Klick Health as a medical animator on the Sci Viz team and am available for freelance projects.
