                <p class="portfolio">This 2D patient education animation was created in collaboration with the
                    <a href="https://www.antimicrobialstewardship.com/">SHS-UHN Antimicrobial Stewardship Program</a>
                    for hospital inpatients and their families. Our goal was to
                    communicate the concept of a microbiome, as well as common misconceptions and the importance of
                    antibiotics to a lay, patient audience. From developing the script to storyboarding, asset creation
                    and production, our team (Sarah Crawley, Maiko Matsuda, Lisa Qiu) produced an animation that conveys
                    this information in an approachable and engaging manner.<br><br>
