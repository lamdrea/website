                        to
                        study in developing treatments for kidney-related illnesses. As a result, researchers are
                        working
                        towards developing a functional 'in vitro' model of the kidneyâ€”the term 'in vitro' refers to
                        cells/organisms/molecules that are studied on outside of its natural environment. A successful,
                        functioning in vitro kidney model would have huge implications for the public, including faster
                        drug
                        development, a diminished need for animal models, and personalized medicine.

                        Biomedical engineers at the University of Toronto achieved a big milestone
                        in engineering specialized kidney cells called podocytes. This animation was created so that the
