                    <p class="portfolio">Kidneys are an important organ in our body, but they are particularly difficult
                        to
                        study in developing treatments for kidney-related illnesses. As a result, researchers are
                        working
                        towards developing a functional 'in vitro' model of the kidneyâ€”the term 'in vitro' refers to
                        cells/organisms/molecules that are studied on outside of its natural environment. A successful,
                        functioning in vitro kidney model would have huge implications for the public, including faster
                        drug
                        development, a diminished need for animal models, and personalized medicine.

                        <br><br>
                        Biomedical engineers at the University of Toronto achieved a big milestone
                        in engineering specialized kidney cells called podocytes. This animation was created so that the
                        clients could communicate and promote their research to <b><u>both</u></b> a lay and research
                        audience.

                        <strong>Goals: </strong> My clients wanted an animation that they could flexibly use
                        depending who their audience was.
                        Their first goal was to have visuals to accompany their research at conferences with peers and
                        stakeholders, while the second goal was to promote their field to the general public.
                        <br><br>
                        <strong>Solution: </strong>
                        Depending on who the audience is, my clients could clip this animation to suit their needs,
                        while also being able to play it as a whole piece. The animation is sectioned into 4 chapters,
                        where chapters 1 & 4 introduces the problem and dives into the long-term implications of their
                        field, while chapters 2 & 3 contains the science and research findings. This is also why there 
                        are stylistic differences, where 1 & 4 are more simple and
                        playful for a general audience, whereas 2 & 3 are more photorealistic to appeal to peers,
                        investors and stakeholders.
