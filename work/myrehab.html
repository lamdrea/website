                        MyRehab is a concept mobile application designed for rehabilitation patients.

                        Based on my personal experience working in a physiotherapy clinic, I noticed that patients often
                        did
                        not keep up with their prescribed exercises for various reasons: forgetting, laziness, losing
                        their
                        instruction sheet, not seeing improvement, and more. This impeded their recovery and made it
                        difficult for their clinicians to assess the patient's progress as well as the effectiveness of
                        the prescribed exercises.
                        <br><br>
                        To encourage patient and clinician engagement, MyRehab:
                    </p>
                    <li>stores the patients' prescribed exercises</li>
                    <li>sends reminders</li>
                    <li>allows the user to log their exercise progress and daily pain</li>
                    <li>provides data visualizations for their progress</li>
                    <li>celebrates little milestones</li>

                        <strong>Constraints: </strong>Due to the short amount of time for this project, my main goal was to determine the main
                        features of this app, followed by creating mockup UI screens to accompany my idea.
                        If I were to redo this project again, I would like to have been more thorough in my research and
                        design, such as building more iterations of my wireflow, wireframing, prototyping and user
                        testing.
