                        MyRehab is a concept mobile application designed for rehabilitation patients.
                        <br><br>
                        Based on my personal experience working in a physiotherapy clinic, I noticed that patients often did
                        not keep up with their prescribed exercises for various reasons: forgetting, laziness, losing their
                        instruction sheet, not seeing improvement, and more. This impeded their recovery and made it
                        difficult for their clinicians to assess the patient's progress as well as the effectiveness of
                        the prescribed exercises.
                        <br><br>
                        To encourage patient and clinician engagement, MyRehab:
                    </p>
                    <li>stores the patients' prescribed exercises</li>
                    <li>sends reminders</li>
                    <li>allows the user to log their exercise progress, in addition to daily pain</li>
                    <li>provides data visualizations for their progress</li>
                    <li>celebrates little milestones</li>

                        By providing visual and physical means to view their journey over time, coupled with celebratory
                        milestones, patients are encouraged to follow their rehabilitation plan. 
                        
                        <br><br>
                        Moreover, the app also
                        benefits clinicians during patient visits by providing data to assess the patient's progress
                        outside
                        of therapy sessionsâ€”allowing for improved rehabilitation plans that are specific to the patient.
                        <br><br>
                        Together, these factors benefit the healthcare system by encouraging patient and clinician
                        engagement for rehabilitation.
